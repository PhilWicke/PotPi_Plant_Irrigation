# PotPi - Pot Plant Irrigation System for Raspberry Pi 3

The irrigation system is build using a Raspberry Pi 3. The additional hardware:
 * 2x Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensors (analog)
 * 2x Mini Water pumps
 * 1x 4 Channel 5V Relais 
 * 1x MPC3008 Analog to Digital Module
 * 1x Breadboard
 * 1x 9V Battery
 * Jumper Cables
 
The initial set for the main hardware was bought as a pack [here](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07TJQSHR2). Since the moisture sensors are providing analog data, but the pi needs a digital signal, I also bough the MPC3008 module. Importantly, this code requires the [py-spidev library](https://github.com/doceme/py-spidev).

This is work in progress. For more information feel free to contact me.
